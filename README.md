Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js(v14 or higher)

SQLite (database will be created locally by Sequelize)

Any IDE or code editor (e.g., VS Code)

Steps to Install
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd micro-instagram-backend
Install the dependencies:

bash
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory to store environment variables such as server port (SQLite will be used by default without the need for a DB host or credentials):

plaintext
PORT=your-preferred-port
Project Setup
Database Configuration
Sequelize will automatically create and use an SQLite database file locally. You donâ€™t need to set up a PostgreSQL or MySQL database server.

Example for SQLite:

plaintext
DB_STORAGE=./database.sqlite
PORT=3000
Migrations
Run the migration to create the tables in the database:

bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
This will create an SQLite database file in the root directory (e.g., ./database.sqlite).

Start the Server
To run the server locally, use the following command:

bash
npm start
This will start the server at the configured PORT.
